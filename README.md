# Banshee

A robust C++ and Vulkan-based framework for developing interactive 3D applications. Designed to be linked as a separate DLL. Current supported features:
* Model loading with the ability to read and load textures and color data for each unique sub-mesh 
* Material system
* Camera system
* Input handling
* Logger
* Rendering system powered by the Vulkan API  

Work in progress:
* Lighting system (directional light, point light, spot light) 

Future Plans:
* Shadow mapping
* Physics integration (e.g., Bullet Physics for collision detection)
* Post-processing effects
