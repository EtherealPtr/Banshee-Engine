Banshee is a robust C++ and Vulkan-based 3D rendering engine designed to easily create interactive applications. The engine is still in an early development stage and much work is yet to be carried out. Currenty, the engine supports the following features:

<ul>
<li> Custom model loading with the ability to read and load textures and vertex data for each unique sub-mesh within a model </li>
<li> Input handling </li>
<li> Logging (in console and externally) </li>
<li> Camera system </li>
<li> High-performance rendering system with the Vulkan API </li>
<li> Lighting (basic phong shading implementation) </li>
<li> Functional but currently minimal material system </li>
</ul>

<h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
The next update will bring the following enhancements:

<ul>
<li> An improved lighting system to support for more light casters, including directional lights, point lights, and spotlights </li>
<li> Support for multiple lights in a scene </li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
To get started, clone the repository and open the solution file in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. After that, simply click the Local Windows Debugger button to build and run the project. Please note that a project build system is not yet in place, but one will be coming soon. Additionally, Banshee has only been tested on Windows, so compatibility with other operating systems is not guaranteed.

<h1>The Plan</h1>
Banshee aims to be a user-friendly, plug-and-play engine. It outputs core functionality to a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file, enabling users to link their projects with the Banshee library and start rendering shapes or custom models immediately. The engineâ€™s robust input handling system allows easy control of shapes using a mouse and keyboard.

<h1>Future Features</h1>
Planned enhancements include:
<ul>
<li> Normal mapping </li>
<li> Shadow mapping </li>
<li> Improved input system to handle joysticks </li>
<li> Improved lighting system to efficiently handle a huge amount of light sources (deferred rendering) </li>
<li> Physics integration (e.g., Bullet Physics for collision detection) </li>
<li> Audio system </li>
<li> Post-processing effects </li>
</ul>

<h1>Banshee's Architecture</h1>
Banshee utilizes a layered architecture approach, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. There are currently a total of 3 layers that make up the Banshee engine.

<h2>Foundation Layer</h2>
The Foundation layer contains core functionalities essential for the engine, including:

<ul>
<li> Logging system </li>
<li> Resource loading mechanisms to load files and images </li>
<li> INI file parsing </li>
<li> Input handling (utilizes the GLFW library) </li>
<li> Entity-Component System </li>
<li> Observer pattern to easily notify for when a component is changed </li>
<li> Timer and other core utilities </li>
</ul>

<h2>Graphics Layer</h2>
Built on top of the Foundation layer, the Graphics layer manages all graphics-related operations, including:

<ul>
<li> Vulkan renderer </li>
<li> Mesh system </li>
<li> Light system </li>
<li> Camera class </li>
<li> Window management (utilizes the GLFW library) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Application Layer</h2>
<p>The Application layer integrates components from the Foundation and Graphics layers. It includes the main entry point of the program, orchestrating the initialization and execution of the engine.</p>
